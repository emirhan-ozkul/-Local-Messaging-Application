(Dear user, remember that this is a project. This project only contains basic and educational elements.)
If you have installed this project, follow these steps:

1- Run the Server.py file. As long as Server.py remains open, the server will stay active.
2- On the machines you want to use for messaging, run the Client.py file. This file acts as the interface for messaging.

Issues:

If you launched Server.py but nothing appears in the terminal, follow these steps:
1- Check the IP address of the machine where Server.py is running and take note of it.
2- The default IP address for Server.py is "192.168.1.2". If your server machine has a different IP, update the "IP: 'xxx.xxx.x.x'" section in both Server.py and Client.py with the correct server IP.
